Ranger v.1.5.0
==============

Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility
and a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console.
It visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy
on one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
where you'll be going.

The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight Commander,
though Ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys or the mouse.

The program is written in Python (2.6 or 3.1) and uses curses for the
text-based user interface.


Getting Started
---------------

Ranger can be started without installing:  Just run ranger.py.  If you want to
install it anyway, the INSTALL file contains instructions.

After starting ranger, you can use the Arrow Keys (or hjkl) to navigate, Enter
to open a file or type Q to quit.  The column on the right shows a preview of
the current file.  The second from the right is the main column and the others
show parent directories.

The manual page of ranger contains a documentation of rangers functions,
keybindings, commands and options.  You can access it by typing "?" in ranger,
running "man ranger" or view it online.

An easy way to customize ranger is running "ranger --copy-config=all"
and editing the new files in ~/.config/ranger/.
